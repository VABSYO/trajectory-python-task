Yo. What up?

This here is an AMAZING, OUT OF THE WORLD, BETTER THAN THE BEST CALCULATOR.

Don't believe me? Try it out for yourself!

Imma leave some snaps of the calculator here for you guys to see.

Add anything you want extra and we might make it more better.

Who needs CASIO calcs anyways when we have this?
